# Algebraic closure

The characteristic of a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ is the smallest positive number $n$ such that $0=\sum_{n}1$. If $n$ does not exist then the charachteristic is $0$.

For any galois field $GF(q)$ where $q = p^k$ for prime $p$ and integer $k>0$

# Torsion points

The $\ell$-torsion points $E[\ell]$ of an elliptic curve $E$ are defined as $E[\ell]=\{P\in E(\mathbb{\bar{F}}) \mid [\ell] P = O \}$
